1. create 2 players

2. one of the players should send a message to second player (let's call this player "initiator")

3. when a player receives a message should send back a new message that contains the received message concatenated with the message counter that this player sent.

4. finalize the program (gracefully) after the initiator sent 10 messages and received back 10 messages (stop condition)
